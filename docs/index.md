## Privacy Mediation Cards

This card deck – the Privacy Mediation Cards – introduces technologies and principles that can be put together to create privacy mediating procedures for various kinds of body-worn devices with an integrated camera, e.g., devices such as Google Glass. It is available as [print-on-demand via Make Playing Cards](Print-on-Demand) (at cost price). You may also print it out yourself using the .pdf in the accompanying github repository.

This card deck helps teams of designers and developers to broaden their thinking, and develop solutions for socially adequate usage of body-worn cameras that go beyond making a binary decision for either banning or allowing body-worn cameras. 

It can also be used as part of participatory design activity to involve stakeholders with varying technical backgrounds (or no technical background) in the design process.

The card deck has been developed as part of my doctoral research at the [HCI Lab at the University of Oldenburg](https://hci.uni-oldenburg.de/) and [OFFIS - Institute for IT](https://www.offis.de/). My PhD thesis (11/2019) is published with OLWIR:
